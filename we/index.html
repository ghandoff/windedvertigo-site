              <p>garrett jaeger [he/him] is the founder of winded.vertigo, a learning design collective based in marinwood, california. he steers this collective of creatives to focus on projects that weave together design principles and scientific rigor–to explore questions and create conditions for playful learning.</p>
              <p>garrett was an evidence specialist at the LEGO foundation for five years, where developmental needs were viewed as design opportunities for creating flow in playful learning experiences. he helped shift research at LEGO from traditional focus groups and paper-and-pencil tests into ai-enabled documentation of what occurs <em>in situ</em> as children are learning through play. garrett led a similar integration of stealth assessment within programmatic activities.</p>
              <p>his work has been contextualized in numerous geographic contexts around the world. as a former teacher in preschools, secondary schools, and universities, garrett continues designing and facilitating playful experiences where children inspire adults, ideas lead logistics, and evidence checks intuition.</p>

              <p>jamie champions inclusion by design and playing with uncertainty, grounding practice in theory, and valuing practice-based evidence. he is driven by a deeply held belief in the power of collaboration and the importance of relational, human-focused approaches. this drive stems from his work in the fields of mental health and neurodevelopment, where he witnessed an increasingly pathologized and fractured field.</p>
              <p>with a diverse professional background spanning teaching, play work, family support, lecturing, training, strategy, policy work, and international consultancy, jamie's career has seen him partner with a wide array of institutions, from charities and government bodies to global corporations.</p>
              <p>jamie builds frameworks around which practice can sit, bringing coherence and connecting disparate or fractured notions and concepts. as a founding member of special networks, jamie challenges traditional hierarchies of evidence and co-creates solutions for social inequalities as well as addressing universal needs.</p>
