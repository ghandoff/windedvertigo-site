      "quadrantStory": "you're in the product × design quadrant—where learning science meets rapid prototyping. this is where we build the tools, games, and experiences that teach through doing - and are designed to flex around the inherent variability of how humans learn.",
      "story": "we kick off with a concept sprint—exploring the problem space, sketching multiple approaches, and converging on the strongest direction. then we prototype rapidly, building just enough to test our core assumptions. playtests happen early and often, with real users in realistic contexts. we synthesise findings after each round and iterate. by the end of sprint two, you have a validated concept and a clear path to production.",
      "crossover": "crossing boundaries: great products don't just emerge from intuition—they're shaped by evidence. we bake research into every sprint, testing assumptions with users and measuring learning outcomes. design and research aren't separate phases; they're intertwined throughout.",
