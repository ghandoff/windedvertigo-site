      "story": "we kick off with a concept sprint—exploring the problem space, sketching multiple approaches, and converging on the strongest direction. then we prototype rapidly, building just enough to test our core assumptions. playtests happen early and often, with real users in realistic contexts. we synthesise findings after each round and iterate. by the end of sprint two, you have a validated concept and a clear path to production.",
