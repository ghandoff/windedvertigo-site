      "promise": "build learning experiences your team actually wants to use.",
      "quadrantStory": "you're in the people × design quadrant—where behaviour change meets creative craft. this is where we build the tools that shift mindsets, not just transfer information.",
      "story": "we start with a discovery session to understand your learning goals and audience. then we move into rapid prototyping—sketching session flows, testing activities, and iterating based on what we learn. we pilot the experience with a real cohort, gather structured feedback, and refine the design. by the end, you have a learning experience that's been tested in the field and is ready to scale.",
      "crossover": "our design work is always informed by research—we build in feedback loops and measurement from day one, so you're not just launching something that feels good, but something you can prove works.",
      "outcomes": [
        { "title": "co-designed session kit", "detail": "we work alongside your team to build a facilitation toolkit that reflects your culture, your language, and your goals—not an off-the-shelf template." },

      "title": "pinpoint & prove",
      "promise": "show exactly where your approach moves the needle—with evidence that stands up to scrutiny.",
      "quadrantStory": "you're in the people × research quadrant—where rigorous measurement meets human complexity. this is where we prove that your interventions actually change how people think, feel, and act.",
      "story": "we begin by mapping your theory of change to measurable outcomes. then we design a lightweight evaluation approach—selecting validated instruments or creating custom measures that fit your context. we collect baseline data, observe your intervention in action, and gather post-programme responses. the analysis goes beyond simple comparisons to explore moderators and mechanisms. you receive a findings deck that tells the story of your impact in language your stakeholders understand.",
      "crossover": "research without design is just measurement. we bring a designer's eye to how we collect data—making surveys engaging, interviews conversational, and dashboards actionable. the best evidence comes from participants who actually want to engage with your evaluation.",

      "title": "build & iterate",

      "quadrantStory": "you're in the product × design quadrant—where learning science meets rapid prototyping. this is where we build the tools, games, and experiences that teach through doing.",
      "story": "we kick off with a concept sprint—exploring the problem space, sketching multiple approaches, and converging on the strongest direction. then we prototype rapidly, building just enough to test our core assumptions. playtests happen early and often, with real users in realistic contexts. we synthesise findings after each round and iterate. by the end of sprint two, you have a validated concept and a clear path to production.",
      "crossover": "great products don't just emerge from intuition—they're shaped by evidence. we bake research into every sprint, testing assumptions with users and measuring learning outcomes. design and research aren't separate phases; they're intertwined throughout.",
      "outcomes": [
        { "title": "working prototype in 2 sprints", "detail": "not wireframes or mockups—a functional prototype you can put in front of real users and learn from immediately." },

      "story": "we start with a heuristic review—our team evaluates your product against established UDL principles and usability heuristics. then we recruit representative users for moderated testing sessions, observing how they navigate real tasks. we capture video, quantitative metrics, and qualitative feedback. the analysis identifies patterns across users and prioritises issues by impact. you receive a findings report with specific, actionable recommendations and clips that bring the user voice to life.",
      "crossover": "validation isn't the end of the story—it's the beginning of better design. our research always points toward solutions, not just problems. we work closely with your design and dev teams to translate findings into improvements that ship.",
