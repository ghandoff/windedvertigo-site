        <h2>brief overview of the learning agenda</h2>
        
        <p>the overarching goal that the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) has for its programme, <a href="https://www.unprme.org/">Principles in Responsible Management Education</a> (PRME), is to increase the agency of faculty as they integrate the <a href="https://www.unprme.org/the-impactful-five-i5/">Impactful Five</a> (i5) into their pedagogies and curricula. we believe increased agency will help activate them to adapt their teaching and outcomes to meet contextual needs. this phase of development for the PRME initiative includes two intervention themes:</p>
        
        <p>provide the PRME community with the <strong>pedagogical resources</strong> they need to thrive. for example, provide documentation tools that enable faculty to become stronger advocates for responsible management education (RME)</p>
        
        <p>provide sufficient <strong>social support</strong> for the growth (both in size and spirit) of the PRME community of practice (CoP). when faculty feel supported to take risks, they are more likely to change their ways of teaching RME.</p>
        
        <h2>learning strategies & evaluation methods</h2>
        
        <p>we want to learn how faculty best plan and facilitate learning activities for their students. the <a href="https://www.unprme.org/our-people/">PRME secretariat</a> actively supports these efforts to change and develop new teaching approaches. i5 faculty gain access to resources as were requested via surveys and other forms of outreach for the community; communication and coordination tools that help the community to decentralize its operations as a community of practice. these enabling structures support a culture of risk-tolerance, generosity, and value gains from active engagement.</p>
        
        <p>our theory of change: as faculty master playful pedagogies, and thus provide high quality playful learning, RME students experience more playful learning; students develop holistic skills alongside traditional outcomes; students value—and act upon these values—sustainable business practices; business thrive when incoming workforce meets sustainable needs while being prepared to innovate in VUCA world.</p>
        
        <p>this learning agenda attempts to answer our learning questions using validated measurements and rigorous research methods. we provide numerous hands-on training for faculty integration of the PRME pedagogy, which provides a foundation of understanding by faculty in addition to an evidentiary baseline for our monitoring of their pedagogical development.</p>
